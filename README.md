# Support Page
Support page to capture user information to aid with issue.

This is built with [JigSaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co) and will allow you the flexibility to restyle and alter to your own purpose. This site can be generated into a static version and served from any folder.

### Installation
```bash
composer install
```

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

To serve and develop the source run:
```bash
gulp watch
```

To generate the static content run:
```bash
./vendor/bin/jigsaw build
```

Best solution for usage is to have the build folder dropped inside /public/ of your site.
